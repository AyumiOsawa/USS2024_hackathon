Method: the data is purchased on Analisa.io in March 2023

### Data
There are two main datasets: the first one (clean.csv) comes from XXXXX's PhD research, but it was then cleaned and formatted; the second one (HF-dataset.csv) has been downloaded from HuggingFace (newsmediabias/Social_media_cleaned_data) but formatted to meet our needs.

The CSV files have 3 columns, one for the date (only clean.csv has content in it), one for the caption, and one for the prediction.
